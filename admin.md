# Administration
## How can we send commands ("SLEEP", "RESTART", "ARE-YOU-THERE", etc) to individual nodes in the network, rather than treat them as pass-through intermediaries?

TO send this to individual nodes in the network, we can have an admin that controls the entire server or database where the messages pass from node to node. For example, the admin can provide these commands ("SLEEP", "RESTART", "ARE-YOU-THERE", etc) and send them to the nodes that need them. the admin in the server sends these commands to the specific necessary nodes and then they can be received.
