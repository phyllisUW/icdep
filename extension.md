# Extension
## How can we add additional features without breaking previous functionality? Consider:
## Send to any individual on the whole UW campus
## Specify whether contents are ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values
## Keep a record of what nodes the card has passed throughYour extension mechanism should allow for any kind of extension we can imagine

We can add additional features without breaking previous functionalities if we use the same method we discussed in class, such as making sure that everyone in UW has an unique ID or if the messages have access to a database system of just UW people. Each message would also declare its status of receiving or not during the transmission like mentioned in class. The message can be sent through there, with the same rules of traveling across the various nodes and using the same anti-duplication method, of unique identifying numbers for each message, and then final node being marked and unique as the final. Because I know people in the UW databases each have a UW NetID, this can be used to make sure messages don't duplicate and reach everyone. So, we can send the messages based on the UW NetID following all the rules that are already existing, but extending to a UW database.


To specify whether contents are ASCII text, unicode text, or binary values, you could add metadata in the same way that I learned webpages have metadata in the HTML if you look for it. With this, you can mention what kind of text or values are going to be in the message. This way, people will be able to see what kind of text or values it is when they send the message. The metadata can declare if the message is ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values.

To keep a record of what nodes the card has passed through, we can use the same method that we mentioned in class, where each time someone or a node recieves the message, they declare that they have declared the message and that they are now passing it to the next node. However, an extension could be adding a documentation or log that the message has been passed through these nodes. They can log the nodes that they have passed through and we can access the logs to see which nodes the messages have bypassed and see the errors if they happen.
